  "textContent": "Visible from the hills above where I live in Somerset is the proposed site of one of the craziest, most worrying projects the government has put its hand to.\nMinisters led by David Cameron want to allow the French state-owned energy company EDF to spend the best part of ten years building a new nuclear power plant next to an old one at Hinkley Point, Bridgewater, looking across the Bristol Channel to Wales, at a cost of more than \u00a324billion.\nThis is equivalent to the combined costs of the vast Crossrail project in London, the revamping of Terminal 2 at Heathrow and the 2012 London Olympics, all put together. Indeed the cost of just this one power station promises to be as much as half the estimated \u00a350 billion bill for of the HS2 high-speed rail link, the most expensive engineering project planned in Britain.\nThe Hinkley Point scheme, which will be partly financed by a huge tranche of cash from the Chinese, is so absurdly expensive the government could only persuade EDF to build it by agreeing that it could charge nearly double its present wholesale cost for the electricity it will produce. This will be passed on to us all through our electricity bills, at a guaranteed, inflation-proof price for 35 years.\nAthough the European Commission in Brussels has agreed to this highly dubious arrangement (we may well ask why we need to get its permission to go ahead in the first place), this colossal subsidy has so enraged Austria\u2019s anti-nuclear government that it is taking the UK deal to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it contravenes the EU\u2019s state subsidy rules.\nThis is the least of the practical objections to giving the Hinkley project the go-ahead however. Equally worrying is that, in return for all that vast subsidy paid by ordinary Britons to a French state-owned company, we will be getting only a relatively small amount of electricity (a capacity at any one time of up to 3,200 megawatts) at a ludicrously inflated price.\nFor that same \u00a324billion, an estimate that could well rise much further in the future, we could get 20 new gas-fired power stations. These would be capable of generating 40,000 megawatts, or more than 12 times as much electricity as the new Hinkley, at little more than half the price charged to us consumers, and without a penny being paid to the French in subsidy.\nEven more alarming is the fact that the particular type of nuclear reactor EDF wants us to buy, known as the European Pressurised Reactor, has already become highly controversial and has been riddled with design problems.\nThe evidence for saying this is to be found in the two European Pressurised Reactors EDF is already involved in building in Normandy and Finland.\nBoth have encountered such serious design and construction problems that they are running years over schedule and billions of euros over budget. Energy analysts say we would have been better off going for an Advanced Pressure Reactor, the APR1400, of the type South Korean engineers have been successfully building in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 on time, on budget and at half the cost of Hinkley Point.\nIn other words, Britain, which once led the world in nuclear reactor technology, is buying one of the craziest, most expensive white elephants imaginable: a power station which, if it does eventually perform as required, will not be ready for at least another eight years to produce a comparatively small amount of the most costly nuclear electricity in the world. It is little wonder that the project has been coming under withering criticism.\nPaul Massara, chief executive of RWE nPower, one of the biggest energy companies, said recently that future generations would ask how Britain could have agreed to such an \u2018expensive mistake\u2019.\nAnd yet, alarmingly, the government is absolutely relying on the success of this project as a first step in its plan to replace our eight existing nuclear power stations, which are currently still providing nearly a fifth of all the electricity that we use.\nAll but one of these are now so old that within a decade or so they will have to be shut down.\nBut so fraught have been the negotiations over Hinkley that, as yet, there are no firm plans to build any more new nuclear power stations; a fact which threatens to leave a very large hole in our ability to produce power.\nThe reason the government has been so desperate to get a new source of nuclear power is that it is blindly planning to phase out all the existing coal and gas-fired power stations which supply two-thirds of our electricity.\nThis is because coal and gas emit CO2 and under Ed Miliband\u2019s Climate Change Act introduced in 2008 we are legally committed to cut our CO2 emissions by such a huge amount that within 15 years or so the government wants to see all our electricity produced by \u2018carbon-free\u2019 power plants.\nBy then, the government\u2019s target is to see most of our electricity coming from such \u2018renewables\u2019 as windfarms and solar panels. However, as all of us except the government and the BBC seem to realise, this is hardly going to keep our lights on and our economy functioning during all those times when the wind isn\u2019t blowing and the sun isn\u2019t shining.\nSo, in order to do so, we will need an ever greater amount of back-up from grown-up power stations that we can rely on; capable of providing instant power at any time of day or night should the supply from those wonderful windfarms suddenly drop towards zero.\nThe government talks vaguely about how this back-up can be provided by new nuclear power stations it dreams of, but what it doesn\u2019t allow for is that, even if we did have all that new nuclear power up and running, it is the least practical way imaginable by which to provide instantly available back-up when windfarms fail to produce.\nNuclear power needs to run all the time, to provide what is called \u2018baseload\u2019 electricity. It is extremely difficult to ramp power production from nuclear plants up or down, only when it is needed.\nTo provide backup, what we really need is more gas-fired power stations, of the kind which can reliably and almost instantly provide electricity far more cheaply and efficiently than any windfarm or, indeed, Hinkley Point.\nBut the government is making such a pig\u2019s ear of its crazy energy policy, and so contemptuous is it about gas-fired power stations because they emit dreadful, \u2018dirty, polluting\u2019 CO2, that energy firms are becoming increasingly reluctant to build any more.\nWhen will our politicians wake up to the reality of what this incomprehensible approach to energy has in store for us?\nThere is no sign of the government wavering in its commitment, despite all the objections. Tellingly, Mr Cameron plans to put his personal seal on the Hinkley Point deal when the Chinese president visits Britain in October, presumably to oil the wheels of trade with the superpower.\nWhen, as a result of this lunacy, our lights begin to go out and our computer-dependent economy starts grinding to a halt, what excuses will the politicians come up with?\n\u00a0\n",
